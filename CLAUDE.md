# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

R&D Player — a custom web video player built with React 19, TypeScript, and Shaka Player 5 for adaptive streaming (DASH/HLS). Replaces native browser controls with a dark-themed custom overlay. Supports ClearKey DRM auto-detection, multi-track audio/subtitles, playback diagnostics, and sleep/wake recovery.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start Vite dev server with HMR
- `npm run build` — TypeScript check + Vite production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (flat config, ESLint 9+)
- `npm run test` — Vitest in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` — Vitest single run (CI mode)
- `npm run test:coverage` — Coverage report
- Run a single test file: `npx vitest run src/utils/formatTime.test.ts`
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright E2E tests (all browsers)
- `npx playwright test --project=chromium` — E2E for specific browser

## Architecture

Entry: `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` → `src/App.tsx`

**App.tsx** — Root component. Renders a URL input form; on submit passes the manifest URL to ShakaPlayer.

**ShakaPlayer** (`src/components/ShakaPlayer.tsx`) — Bridge between React and the native Shaka Player library. Handles:
- One-time polyfill installation at module level
- Manifest fetching to auto-detect ClearKey DRM (`cenc:default_KID`)
- Prompting for decryption key when DRM is detected
- Playback state persistence via sessionStorage
- Error handling with severity categorization
- Clean destruction on unmount via a `destroyed` safety flag

**VideoControls** (`src/components/VideoControls.tsx`) — The largest component (~715 lines). Custom overlay UI with 20+ state variables managing:
- Play/pause, seek bar, volume slider, quality/speed/audio/subtitle popups
- Auto-hide (3s inactivity timer)
- Sleep/wake recovery (visibilitychange + timer-gap detection with 5s guard window)
- Right-click context menu (Stats toggle) rendered via React portal
- Fullscreen API integration

**StatsPanel** (`src/components/StatsPanel.tsx`) — Real-time diagnostics overlay (13 stat rows, 1s update interval). Accessed via right-click context menu. Uses browser PlaybackQuality API with Shaka stats fallback.

**FilmstripTimeline** (`src/components/FilmstripTimeline.tsx`) — Canvas-based filmstrip panel below the video. Renders a zoomable/scrollable timeline with thumbnails generated by a web worker. Accepts an optional `clearKey` prop for encrypted content. Features:
- Two rendering modes: *packed* (one I-frame thumbnail per segment, segment width ≤ thumbnail width) and *gap* (multiple intra-frame thumbnails per segment when zoomed in)
- Per-segment bitrate graph drawn below thumbnails with colored bars (measured vs estimated)
- GOP tooltip on hover over bitrate bars showing per-frame size bars and per-type stats
- Save frame via right-click context menu with position-based frame targeting (see `docs/frame-pipeline.md`)
- Color-coded frame borders: red=I, blue=P, green=B

**useThumbnailGenerator** (`src/hooks/useThumbnailGenerator.ts`) — Hook that manages the thumbnail worker lifecycle. Extracts segment URLs from Shaka's manifest, spawns the worker, and handles lazy-loading based on visible viewport. When `clearKey` is provided for encrypted streams, passes the hex key to the worker for self-decryption. Exposes:
- `thumbnails` — `Map<number, ImageBitmap>`: I-frame thumbnails keyed by segment start time
- `intraFrames` — `Map<number, ImageBitmap[]>`: multiple decoded bitmaps per segment for gap mode
- `intraFrameTypes` — `Map<number, FrameType[]>`: I/P/B types for each intra bitmap
- `intraTimestamps` — `Map<number, number[]>`: exact CTS seconds for each intra bitmap (from mp4box, includes composition time offsets)
- `gopStructures` — `Map<number, GopFrame[]>`: frame types + byte sizes for GOP tooltip
- `saveFrame(time, framePosition?)` — one-shot full-resolution frame decode from the active stream; `framePosition` (0..1) identifies the frame by display-order index to avoid cross-stream CTS mismatches
- Memory eviction: bitmaps outside 3× the visible viewport span are closed and removed

**thumbnailWorker** (`src/workers/thumbnailWorker.ts`) — Web Worker that fetches media segments, extracts samples via mp4box, decodes frames with VideoDecoder, and posts back ImageBitmaps. For CENC-encrypted content, integrates with `cencDecrypt` to decrypt samples before decoding. Key subsystems:

- **I-frame thumbnails** (`processQueue`): extracts sync samples only, decodes one I-frame per segment for the packed filmstrip view
- **Intra-frame generation** (`handleGenerateIntra`): decodes ALL frames in a segment, captures N evenly-spaced bitmaps for gap mode. Returns exact CTS timestamps alongside bitmaps so the component can snap to real presentation times
- **Frame type classification** (`classifyFrameTypes`): max-CTS heuristic — iterates samples in decode order tracking the highest CTS seen; sync samples → I, non-sync with CTS ≥ maxCts → P, non-sync with CTS < maxCts → B. Returns `GopFrame[]` in display (CTS) order with byte sizes
- **Active stream frame types** (`getActiveFrameTypes`): classifies from the watched rendition (e.g. 1080p) rather than the lowest-quality thumbnail stream, since different renditions may have different GOP structures. Results are cached by segment URL
- **Save frame** (`handleSaveFrame`): decodes all frames in the target segment at full resolution. When `framePosition` is provided (0..1), captures by display-order output index (`Math.round(position * (totalFrames - 1))`), which is immune to cross-stream CTS mismatches. Falls back to CTS-based timestamp matching when no position is given
- **GOP structure** (`requestGop`): lightweight handler that classifies frame types without video decoding, used for the GOP tooltip on hover

**useBitrateGraph** (`src/hooks/useBitrateGraph.ts`) — Hook that computes per-segment bitrate for the filmstrip graph. Data sources in priority order:
1. Measured from network via Shaka's response filter (actual `response.data.byteLength`)
2. Byte-range metadata from segment references in the manifest
3. Estimated from the variant's declared `bandwidth` (lighter color in graph)

Formula: `bitrateBps = (bytes × 8) / segmentDuration`. Listens to `variantchanged`/`adaptation` events for rendition switches and retains historical measurements across switches.

**filmstripFrameMapping** (`src/utils/filmstripFrameMapping.ts`) — Pure functions modeling the save-frame pipeline for testability. Three stages that must agree:
1. Paint loop frame assignment: slot index → `captureIndices[arrIdx]` → which frame is displayed
2. Context-menu snap: click pixel → slot → `arrIdx` → normalized `framePosition` (0..1)
3. Worker frame capture: `framePosition` → `Math.round(position * (totalFrames - 1))` → display-order output index

The diagnostic test (`filmstripFrameMapping.test.ts`) runs the full pipeline at every zoom level (packed through max) with composition time offsets (0–3 frames) and cross-stream CTS mismatches. Run with `npx vitest run src/utils/filmstripFrameMapping.test.ts`.

**cencDecrypt** (`src/workers/cencDecrypt.ts`) — CENC decryption utility for ClearKey DRM in the thumbnail worker. Parses `tenc` and `schm` boxes from mp4box's tree, manually parses `senc` boxes from raw segment bytes (mp4box's senc parser is disabled), and performs AES-128-CTR decryption via Web Crypto API with subsample support. Key details:
- Only supports `cenc` scheme (AES-CTR); bails on `cbcs`/`cbc1`
- IV is right-padded to 16 bytes per CENC spec
- With subsamples: concatenates encrypted ranges into a single decrypt call, then re-interleaves with clear bytes
- Decryption is fully opt-in — gated on `clearKeyHex` being provided in the worker message

**softwareDecrypt** (`src/utils/softwareDecrypt.ts`) — Software ClearKey decryption fallback for browsers where ClearKey EME is absent or silently fails. Uses a two-layer detection strategy:
- **Layer 1 — pre-check** (`hasClearKeySupport()`): Probes `navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess('org.w3.clearkey', ...)` before loading. Result cached for session. Returns `false` on browsers where EME is entirely absent (e.g. Linux WebKitGTK) — software decryption is used directly, skipping EME entirely. Returns `true` on Chromium, Firefox, macOS WebKit.
- **Layer 2 — post-load detection** (`waitForDecryption()`): After loading with EME, polls `video.readyState` every 50ms for 1.5s. If readyState stays at HAVE_METADATA (1) despite buffered data, EME decryption silently failed — the CDM produced garbage the decoder drops. The player then unloads and reloads with the software decryption response filter. This catches macOS WebKit, where the EME API exists and the pre-check passes, but actual decryption silently fails.
- The two layers are complementary: Layer 1 prevents `player.load()` from hanging/throwing on browsers without EME; Layer 2 catches browsers that lie about EME support.

When activated, `configureSoftwareDecryption()` registers an async Shaka response filter with three stages:
- MANIFEST — strips `ContentProtection` elements from MPD XML so Shaka skips EME setup
- INIT_SEGMENT — caches original init bytes, parses tenc via mp4box, imports CryptoKey, rewrites `encv→avc1` and removes `sinf`/`pssh` via `stripInitEncryption`
- MEDIA_SEGMENT — parses senc, extracts samples via mp4box (using cached init), decrypts each sample in-place within mdat via `decryptSample`
- Segment type detection uses box presence (`moov` for init, `moof` for media) rather than Shaka's `AdvancedRequestType`, because SegmentBase streams tag sidx (index range) requests as INIT_SEGMENT which would overwrite cached init data
- Reuses utilities from `cencDecrypt.ts` (`importClearKey`, `extractTenc`, `parseSencFromSegment`, `decryptSample`, `findBoxData`) and `stripEncryptionBoxes.ts` (`stripInitEncryption`)
- Only supports `cenc` scheme (AES-CTR)

**Utilities** in `src/utils/`: `formatTime`, `formatTrackRes`, `safeNum`, `formatBitrate` — small pure functions.

## Testing

Unit tests: Vitest + jsdom. Files alongside source (`src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`). See `docs/testing.md` for full details.

E2E tests: Playwright across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Edge. Files in `e2e/`. Uses route-intercepted fixtures (MP4, DASH, encrypted DASH, HEVC, AV1). See `docs/testing.md` for fixtures, CI matrix, codec support matrix, platform nuances, and per-suite documentation.

## Conventions

- CSS classes prefixed with `vp-` (vibe player)
- Shaka Player types accessed via the `shaka` global namespace
- Strict TypeScript (`strict: true`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`)
